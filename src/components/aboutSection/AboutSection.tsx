        <StyledAboutText>
          Hello! I'm Jose, a software engineer based in Jersey City, NJ. Well
          organized person, problem solver, with strong attention to detail.
          <br />
          <br />
          My goal is to keep learning and become better than I was yesterday so
          the products I build are well designed ensuring a great experience for
          the end user.
          <br />
          <br />
          This interest in programming came in at a young age, with the release
          of the 1st gen iPod touch. Seeing what people were making with it had
          me hooked. I used my friend google, and started learning C and
          Objective-C.
          <br />
          <br />
          Fast forward, from interest to hobby it grew. Now here in the web, I
          enjoy building things that live on the internet, from websites and
          applications, to anything in between.
